LUTLP-1#1 Warning
Combinatorial Loop Alert  
130 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is design_1_i/Test_CRO_0/inst/A0[0]. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: design_1_i/Test_CRO_0/inst/Enable_A, design_1_i/Test_CRO_0/inst/Enable_B,
design_1_i/Test_CRO_0/inst/MUX_A1, design_1_i/Test_CRO_0/inst/MUX_A10,

Net design_1_i/Test_CRO_1/inst/Q_8_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/Test_CRO_1/inst/FF_8_inver/O, cell design_1_i/Test_CRO_1/inst/FF_8_inver. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
